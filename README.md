## Overview
This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of customer churn trends within a telecommunications company, utilizing Microsoft Excel to visualize and interpret key performance indicators. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition, with the goal of informing targeted retention strategies. Key dimensions explored include churn rate by customer segment, contract type, monthly charges, tenure, payment methods, and service usage. By uncovering the characteristics of customers most likely to churn, this report empowers decision-makers to proactively address churn drivers, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance long-term loyalty.

## Problem Statement
Despite offering diverse plans and services, telecom companies often struggle to pinpoint why some customers leave while others stay. With rising competition and high acquisition costs, understanding churn behavior across contracts, payments, and demographics is crucial for business success.
This project addresses:
- What service types, payment methods, or demographics influence churn the most?
- How does churn vary by monthly charges or contract duration?
- Which customer segments are most at risk of leaving?
---

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection** - Imported raw data into Microsoft Excel from Kaggle.
2. **Pre-Analysis Planning** - Defined dependent and independent variables. Drafted analysis questions such as:
   - Who churns more: senior citizens or younger customers?
3. **Data Cleaning**
     - Converted data into Excel Tables
     - Removed duplicates, corrected naming inconsistencies
     - Standardized team and player names, handled missing values
4. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   Used Pivot Tables to segment churn by:
   - Monthly charges
   - Contract duration
   - Internet service type
   - Payment method
   - Customer characteristics
5. **Visualization**  
   - Built charts using Excel: Bar, Pie, Doughnut, and Column
   - Created a dynamic dashboard with slicers for easy filtering and insight navigation

### Key Insights:
- Customers paying $78â€“$98 and $18â€“$38 per month had the highest churn rates, suggesting dissatisfaction or affordability concerns in both low and high price ranges.
- The most loyal customers were in the $118â€“$138 range, indicating satisfaction with premium services or bundled offerings.
- Month-to-month contract customers had the highest churn, while one-year and two-year contracts significantly reduced churnâ€”highlighting the value of long-term commitments.
- Paperless billing users churned more (59%) than those receiving physical bills (41%), indicating potential usability or trust issues with digital billing.
- Electronic check users showed the highest churn rate (34%), while customers using automatic payments (bank transfer or credit card) churned the least (22%), reflecting payment convenience impact.
- Non-senior citizens accounted for 84% of churners, suggesting younger or middle-aged users are more prone to switching providers.
- Fiber Optic internet users had the highest churn (3,096 customers), followed by DSL users; customers with no internet had the lowest churn, possibly due to fewer service issues or expectations.
- Customers without partners accounted for 66% of churn, implying that individuals may be less loyal than those in relationships.
- Customers without dependents had a 21% churn rate, compared to 14% for those with dependentsâ€”showing that family responsibilities influence service retention.
- Having dependents had a stronger positive impact on loyalty than having a partner, based on churn percentage differences.
